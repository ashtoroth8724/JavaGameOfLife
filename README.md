Reminder of game of life rules:
1. Any living cell with strictly fewer than two living neighbors dies (referred to
as underpopulation or exposure).
2. Any living cell with strictly more than three living neighbors dies (referred to
as overpopulation or overcrowding).
3. Any dead cell with exactly three living neighbors will come to life. (Referred to as
spreading or growth)
With the implied additional rules:
4. Any living cell with two or three living neighbors continues to live, unchanged.
5. Any dead cell who doesnâ€™t have exactly 3 living neighbors stays dead,
unchanged.
